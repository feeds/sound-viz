# sound-viz

Visualize the soundwaves of you favourite mp3-recordings and listen and watch them as a pdf is generated.
I used the printed versions as presents for others ;)

## How To

Install [Processing 3](https://processing.org), open ```soundwave_rows\soundwave_rows.pde```, set the path to your recording in ```sound_file_name```. 
Click to stop and save as a pdf.
